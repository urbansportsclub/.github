## Engineering Culture

Our engineering culture is built on a foundation of principles that guide us in our day-to-day work and decision-making processes. Below are some key aspects of our culture and a detailed explanation of our engineering principles.

### Agile Development
We follow Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban to ensure our projects are flexible and adaptable. This approach allows us to respond quickly to changes and continuously deliver value to our users.

### Code Reviews
Every pull request goes through a thorough code review process. This practice ensures that our codebase remains clean, maintainable, and bugs-free. It also provides a platform for knowledge sharing and mentorship.

### Continuous Learning
We believe in the power of continuous learning and development. Our team regularly engages in tech talks, workshops, and courses to stay updated with the latest technologies and best practices.

### Innovation
Rather than traditional hackathons, we have "Getting Stuff Done Days" every six weeks. These are two dedicated days for learning and development, where team members can step away from their routine tasks. Whether tackling technical debt, exploring new technology, or working on a side project that can benefit the team, these days are all about innovation and personal growth.

### Engineering Principles

#### ü§ù Empowerment through Alignment
We strive to balance granting autonomy and ensuring alignment towards shared goals to empower our team members to achieve their full potential.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Problem Solving & Pragmatism
We approach challenges with a mindset focused on finding practical and effective solutions. We value simplicity and strive to make data-driven decisions.

#### üåà Diversity of Thoughts
We value diverse perspectives and strive to bring a range of voices to the table in decision-making processes. This diversity enriches our culture and leads to more robust solutions.

#### üöÄ Sustained Momentum
We prioritize maintaining a constant pace and steady progress toward our goals. We believe that momentum is key to achieving long-term success.

#### üí° Fearless Innovation
We encourage taking calculated risks and moving forward with bold ideas, even in uncertainty. We see failures as learning opportunities that bring us closer to success.

#### üëë Ownership and Responsibility
We believe in giving our team members ownership over the projects they work on, from building to running and maintaining. This sense of ownership fosters a culture of accountability and excellence.
